A python script was used to measure the volume of bubbles in real time. 

A standard  [Raspberry Pi camera module](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14028) was utilised.

OpenCV was installed on Raspberry Pi. 
The following [link](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/26/install-opencv-4-on-your-raspberry-pi/) was used for the installation of OpenCV.

The total percentage of red pixels were used to estimate the total volume of dissolved gas post-reactor relative to the total volume of gas introduced into the reactor.
